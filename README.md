# Welcome to PepperPlan! Where we take organizing your class scheduling at Pepperdine to another level!
Pepperplan is an ASP.Net Web Application that was created with the purpose of helping Pepperdine Students and Counslers easily 
access a database of classes and prerequisets that allows you to build a schedule and the app checks for prerequisets. You can also generate a 
plan based on your year, major and minor. Furthermore, if you click any class it shows you what other major classes or electives that you can take that satisfy the requirement!
The Application is done with the first Phase and is currently in production. For any information contact dev@ahmednajiub.com or the current Pepperdine Computer Science Club President.
Here is the Current Website.
