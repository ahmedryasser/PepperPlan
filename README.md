# Welcome to PepperPlan! Where we take organizing your class scheduling at Pepperdine to another level!
During my time at Pepperdine, a significant challenge came to light: students frequently encountered difficulties in securing time with counselors and effectively devising a strategy to complete their degree within the intended timeframe. This predicament prompted the inception of the following initiative.

Introducing Pepperplan: an ASP.Net Web Application meticulously designed to address the needs of Pepperdine students and counselors. The application's primary objective revolves around seamless access to an extensive database encompassing classes and their prerequisites. This resource empowers users to construct schedules while the application diligently verifies prerequisite fulfillment. Moreover, Pepperplan offers the functionality to generate personalized plans based on factors such as academic year, major, and minor.

Noteworthy features include the ability, upon selecting a specific class, to explore alternative major-related courses or elective options that fulfill corresponding requirements. The initial phase of the application's development is complete, and it currently resides in the production phase.

For any inquiries, please feel free to reach out to dev@ahmednajiub.com or contact the current President of the Pepperdine Computer Science Club. It's worth mentioning that I collaborated with Pepperdine's IT department to compile comprehensive major-specific requirements and an Excel list containing all available courses alongside their identifiers. These resources serve as the foundation for the forthcoming database of classes.
